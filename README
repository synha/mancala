This is a mancala search-based AI I wrote at an internship during the summer of 2011
It uses a minimax search with alpha beta pruning, and is implimented in C/UPC
UPC is a mulicore C dialect the company I interned at (Intrepid, Inc.) worked on the GCC fork for.
If you'd like to compile the source without installing UPC, the original C is in mancalaC/ folder
